#  Sudoku Solver in C#

This is a C# console application that solves a given Sudoku puzzle using **backtracking**. It takes a 9x9 grid as input, where empty cells are represented by `0`, and fills in the grid with the correct values according to Sudoku rules.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

This program uses **backtracking**, a depth-first search algorithm that:

1. Traverses the grid to find an empty cell.
2. Tries digits 1 through 9.
3. Validates each digit based on:
   - Row constraints
   - Column constraints
   - 3x3 subgrid constraints
4. Recursively fills the next cell.
5. If no digit is valid, it backtracks and tries a different number in the previous cell.
